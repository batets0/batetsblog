       <p>A lot of reports based on ongoing events (no more than 10 years old), explore the potential of hybrid quantum computing in tackling the challenge of flood prediction or solving big mathematical problems , using examples as a case study. While full-fledged quantum computers remain in their nascent stages, hybrid approaches offer a promising avenue to leverage the unique capabilities of quantum technology in conjunction with classical computing for practical applications (in pharmaceutical, cybersecurity or a recent project by Multiverse Computing) 
 Those endeavors come as a clear statement to emphasize the beneficial side of that technology, which is viewed as the second pillar of what is said to be an industrial revolution or  a very hot technological context.

   Traditional computational fluid dynamics simulations used for flood modeling are computationally expensive, especially when aiming for high resolution and incorporating complex details like buildings and coastal features. This project aims to address this challenge by integrating a quantum circuit into a neural network architecture. </p>
      <p>The current documents exhibit a scientific flavor with  a high sense of expertise, authority, accuracy and relevance. That relevance is also supported by a good amount of technical terms definition from the quantum computing introduction article (quantum computing, superposition, qubits…) Also, they obviously attempt to draw our attention on the combination of two models: the classical model (traditional computers and supercomputers) and the quantum-based model, which in their lenses , are the industry standard of the current  tech landscape. 

	The  first article project utilizes a 32-qubit quantum circuit from Oxford Quantum Circuits alongside a neural network developed by Multiverse Computing.
      This hybrid approach aims to:</p>  
  <p> - Optimize the neural network: The quantum circuit optimizes the neural network, improving its training performance and reducing memory consumption. </p>
  <p> - Increase expressivity: The system enhances the neural network's ability to approximate functions, leading to more accurate predictions. </p>
  <p>  - Scale with more qubits: As larger quantum computers become available, the system can be scaled up for even better accuracy. </p>

	<p>Despite the potential,  both reports raise significant hurdles : </p>
 <p>  - Limited Qubit Capacity: The current 32-qubit circuit is insufficient to handle the entire problem, necessitating data compression techniques. </p>
   <p> - Uncertainty about Scalability: The optimal number of qubits needed and the timeframe for building large-scale quantum computers remain unknown. </p>
 <p>  - Investment Justification: Demonstrating the value proposition of quantum computing compared to classical approaches is crucial to secure substantial investments for further development. </p>
 <p>     - Difficulty to run under normal temperatures: quantum computers need absolute zero to run. </p>
	<p>All those listed opportunities and challenges collected thru labs research,  documentations and technical analysis from SME such as software engineer Abhishek Verma, director Vitor Gaspar or Dr Sam Mugel , are the results of statistical or empirical sources and can be considered credible sources as supporting evidence. 
	Also, the fabric of the articles show both a level of respect between the optimistic and pessimistic views on a quantum computing discussion. This can be seen as a healthy unglazed reliable and objective  restitution of  the industry status quo. </p>
